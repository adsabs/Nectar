We investigate the effectiveness of using 0.4m-class telescopes for monitoring transiting hot Jupiters and their host stars. We consider two representative case studies: WASP-52b with 13 new transits, and HAT-P-23b with 17 new transits and concurrent photometric monitoring covering 78 days. We present updated system parameters and combine our new transit times with previously published results to calculate new ephemerides for both systems. Our analysis of transit mid-times for WASP52b results in a slight preference for a quadratic ephemeris (∆χ<SUP>2</SUP><SUB>ν</SUB> = 0.07, ∆BIC = 1.53 over a linear ephemeris. We discuss the reality of this quadratic ephemeris indicating a period change of δP/δt = -38.6 ± 4 ms yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and consider possible causes. WASP-52 is known to be an active star with previous publications reporting many spot crossing events, however no such events are seen in our new photometry. Our analysis shows that WASP-52 is still active and that the latitude of the spots has likely migrated away from the transit chord. We confirm the inflated nature and circular orbit for HAT-P-23b. Our monitoring of HAT-P-23 reveals a periodicity of 7.015 days with an amplitude of 0.011 mag which we interpret as the rotation period of HAT-P-23. The photometric and transit timing precision achieved in the case studies shows that this class of telescope is capable of precise characterisation and long-term monitoring of transiting hot Jupiters in support of dedicated ongoing and future ground and space based observations.","links_data":["{\"access\": \"open\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"electr\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.newast.2020.101477\"}","{\"access\": \"open\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"preprint\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08379\"}"],"pubnote":["15 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in New Astronomy; doi:10.1016/j.newast.2020.101477"],"property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","PUB_OPENACCESS","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"19326671","page":["101477"],"bibcode":"2021NewA...8301477S","author":["Salisbury, M.

At the late stage of the relaxation evolution of the clusters, standard stellar dynamics predicts that the clusters evolve in a self-similar fashion forming collapsing cores. However, the corresponding mathematical model, the self-similar OAFP equation, has never been solved on the whole energy domain (- 1 &lt; E &lt; 0) . Existing works based on kinds of finite difference methods provide solutions only on the truncated domain - 1 &lt; E ⪅ - 0.2 . To broaden the range of the truncated domain, the present work resorts to a (highly accurate and efficient) Gauss-Chebyshev pseudo-spectral method. We provide a spectral solution accurate to four significant figures on the whole domain. The solution can reduce to a semi-analytical form whose degree of polynomials is only eighteen holding three significant figures.

By reformulating the self-similar OAFP equation in several ways, we improve the accuracies of the spectral solutions and reproduce an existing self-similar solution, which infers that the existing solutions are accurate up to only one significant figure.","links_data":["{\"access\": \"open\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"preprint\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12196\"}","{\"access\": \"\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"electr\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.newast.2020.101474\"}"],"pubnote":["doi:10.1016/j.newast.2020.101474"],"property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"19322586","page":["101474"],"bibcode":"2021NewA...8301474I","author":["Ito, Yuta"],"esources":["EPRINT_HTML","EPRINT_PDF","PUB_HTML"],"email":["yito@gradcenter.cuny.edu"],"citation_count":2,"pub":"New Astronomy","volume":"83","doi":["10.1016/j.newast.2020.101474"],"keyword":["Dense star cluster","Core collapse","Self-similar evolution","Orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck model","Isotropic","Numerical","Pseudo-spectral method","Gauss-Chebyshev polynomial","Physics - Computational Physics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"doctype":"article","read_count":12,"pub_raw":"New Astronomy, Volume 83, article id. 101474.","title":["Self-similar orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation for isotropic spherical dense star clusters (i) accurate pre-collapse solution"],"[citations]":{"num_references":24,"num_citations":2}},{"read_count":5,"pubdate":"2021-02-00","citation_count_norm":0.0,"abstract":"A program of routine observations of lunar occultations has been initiated at the Michael Adrian Observatorium using a 1.2 m telescope equipped with a commercial CMOS camera.

So far only three known analytical solutions are found in the literature, for the following values of n: 0, 1 and 5. A common feature these three solutions share is their boundary conditions: θ(ξ) ∣<SUB>ξ = 0</SUB> = 1 and dθ(ξ)/dξ ∣<SUB>ξ = 0</SUB> = 0 . If a third boundary condition d<SUP>2</SUP> θ(ξ)/dξ<SUP>2</SUP> ∣<SUB>ξ = 0</SUB> ,= - 1 is used, only the solution for n = 1 is able to meet all three. In order to address this difference, our solution aims to be more inclusive and takes into account θ(ξ) =1/ξ and the constant solution. By keeping τ in parametric form, we found out that θ(ξ(τ)) = 1/ξ(τ) → 1 when ξ → 0. Thus proving that 1/ξ → 1 in the origin. It is worth noting that upon integrating the Lane-Emden equation, we came across five parameters. Three of them depend on the three boundary conditions used and two can be adjusted numerically. <P />In order to demonstrate the validity of our solution, we tested it on six cases of interest to the scientific community related to studies on real stars and exoplanets. The adiabatic exponents are n = 1.5 , n = 2 , n = 2.592 , n = 3 , n = 3.23 and n ≃ 5 contained in the intervals 1 &lt; n &lt; 5 and 5 ≲ n &lt; 9. It is worth noting that four of these cases are of particular importance; n = 1.5 , which corresponds to an adiabatic star supported by the pressure of non-relativistic gas; n = 3 , which corresponds to an adiabatic star supported by the pressure of an ultra-relativistic gas. Finally, n = 2.592 and n = 3.23 , which correspond to exoplanets. The obtained solution of the Lane-Emden equation of the first kind proves valid for any value of n.","links_data":["{\"access\": \"\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"electr\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.newast.2020.101458\"}"],"property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"19258196","page":["101458"],"bibcode":"2021NewA...8201458T","identifier":["2021NewA...8201458T","10.1016/j.newast.2020.101458","10.1016/j.newast.2020.101458"],"author":["Torres-Córdoba, Rafael","Martínez-García, Edgar A."],"esources":["PUB_HTML"],"pub_raw":"New Astronomy, Volume 82, article id. 101458.","citation_count":0,"pub":"New Astronomy","volume":"82","doi":["10.1016/j.newast.2020.101458"],"keyword":["Analytical solution","Boundary conditions","Polytropic gas","Ultra-relativistic gas","Adiabatic star","Exoplanets"],"doctype":"article","email":["-","-"],"title":["Exact analytic solution of an unsolvable class of first Lane-Emden equation for polytropic gas sphere"],"[citations]":{"num_references":3,"num_citations":0}},{"read_count":6,"pubdate":"2021-01-00","citation_count_norm":0.0,"abstract":"We explore the Gaia DR2 relative proper motions of seven young, massive, OB type runaway candidate stars presented by Platais et al.

Through graphical discussion, it is noticed that our calculated solutions are physically arguable with the best degree of accuracy for n ∈ [ 1 . 8 , 7) , where parameter n is involved in the model under discussion. However, it is perceived that the presented model violates all the physical conditions for n ∈ { 2 , 4 , 6 } . Finally, it is concluded that the parameter n has a strong impact on the obtained solutions in the context of Bardeen stellar structures.","links_data":["{\"access\": \"open\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"preprint\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02409\"}","{\"access\": \"\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"electr\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.dark.2020.100652\"}"],"pubnote":["23 pages, 17 figures; Phys.

In this work, we have analyzed the γ-ray data in the energy range 100 MeV to 500 GeV from the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations for the period August 4, 2008 to March 31, 2019. The γ-ray emission from AR Scorpii over the last decade is not statistically significant and therefore 2σ upper limit on the integral flux above 100 MeV has been estimated. We reproduce the non-thermal broadband spectral energy distribution of AR Scorpii using an emission model having two synchrotron components due to the relativistic electrons in very high magnetic fields. The first component (Synchrotron-1) broadly describes the emissions at radio to high energy X-rays through the synchrotron radiation originating from a spherical region of radius ~ 1.8 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm and a magnetic field strength of ~ 10<SUP>3</SUP> Gauss. The second component (Synchrotron-2) which reproduces the X-ray emission at lower energies and predicts the γ-ray emission, originates from another spherical region with radius ~ 1.4 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm and a magnetic field strength of ~ 10<SUP>6</SUP> Gauss. The relativistic electron populations in both the emission regions are described by a smooth broken power law energy distribution. The γ-ray emission predicted by the Synchrotron-2 model is below the broadband sensitivity of the Fermi-LAT and is also consistent with the 95% confidence level upper limit on the integral flux above 100 MeV derived from more than 10 years of observations.

However, with new surveys from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder detecting many tens of million of radio sources such an approach is no longer feasible. The Likelihood Ratio (LR) allows the use of additional data about survey objects to be cross matched rather than just position and proximity, such as flux, probability distribution and catalogue surface density. This thesis presents a new software algorithm (LRPY - Likelihood Ratio in PYthon) to automate the process of cross-identifying radio sources with catalogues at other wavelengths using the LR. I demonstrate LRPY by applying it to the ATLAS Data Release 3 and a Spitzer-based multi-wavelength catalogue, identifying 3,848 cross matched sources using my LR-based selection criteria. I found that LRPY could be extended to identify radio sources with multiple infrared counterparts many of which I identify as interacting galaxy pairs. In addition I also investigated if LRPY could be used to select radio sources with more complex morphology, such as double lobe radio sources. This extension to the algorithm is shown to work well in identifying the host of many double lobe radio sources. A subset of 1987 cross matched sources in this thesis have flux density values for all four bands in the Spitzer/IRAC instrument, which allowed me to use various criteria to distinguish between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming galaxies (SFG). I found that 936 radio sources (≈47%) meet both of the Lacy and Stern AGN selection criteria. Of the matched sources, 295 have spectroscopic redshifts and we examine the radio to infrared flux ratio vs redshift, proposing an AGN selection criterion below the Elvis radio-loud (RL) AGN limit for this dataset. Taking the union of all three AGN selection criteria I have identified 956 cross matched sources as AGN (≈48%). From this dataset, we find a decreasing fraction of AGN with lower radio flux densities consistent with other results in the literature. I found there is a strong power law correlation demonstrated using the complete Fusion dataset seen in the AGN arm of the MIR [3.6]-[5.8] vs [4.5]-[8.0] plot for the LACY AGN selection wedge, but there was no such strong correlation for the Stern AGN wedge of the MIR [5.8]-[8.0] vs [3.6]-[4.5] colour-colour plot. Due to this I have analysed the cross matched sources in this thesis for a power law relationship, it was apparent that for the MIR [3.6]-[5.8] vs [4.5]-[8.0] colour-colour plots used for Lacy AGN selection the correlation between the AGN candidate infrared flux ratios to the power-law locus is very strong in the AGN arm. The Stern MIR colour-colour criteria [5.8]-[8.0] vs [3.6]-[4.5] shows no strong correlation for the AGN candidate infrared flux ratios to the power-law locus for the cross matched sources. I have also looked at the relationship between the MIR 8.0μm to radio 1.4GHz relationship, there is a clear distinction between AGN and SFG's. I have also looked at the relationship between the Radio L<SUB>1.4</SUB> GHz and MIR luminosities L<SUB>3.6</SUB> μm and L<SUB>4.5</SUB>μm, as prior work had provided existence of a correlation. What was found is that the higher redshift sources (z&gt;0.3) lie within the top right quadrant of the plots, when the Stern and Lacy AGN are identified we see the majority of these AGN also lie within this same quadrant. Looking at the AGN selected sources we see a slope close to unity at both MIR wavelengths, for 3.6μm the slope is m = 1.004 ± 0.155 and at 4.5μm it was found to be m = 0.980 ± 0.153. I conclude the thesis by summarizing the work and discussing future work to be undertaken as a result of the research.","links_data":["{\"access\": \"\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"electr\", \"url\": \"http://hdl.handle.net/10292/13132\"}"],"id":"18934174","bibcode":"2020PhDT.........1W","identifier":["2020PhDT.........1W"],"author":["Weston, Stuart Duncan"],"esources":["AUTHOR_HTML","PUB_HTML"],"email":["sweston@aut.ac.nz"],"citation_count":0,"pub":"Ph.D. Thesis","property":["ESOURCE","NONARTICLE","REFEREED","AUTHOR_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"keyword":["Galaxy","Catalogues","Algorithm","Radio","Infrared"],"doctype":"phdthesis","pub_raw":"PhD Thesis, Auckland University of Technology, 2020","title":["Astronomical Catalogue Cross Identification for Data Mining and Statistical Analysis of the Infrared and Faint Radio Sky"],"[citations]":{"num_references":0,"num_citations":0}},{"read_count":4,"pubdate":"2020-11-00","citation_count_norm":0.0,"abstract":"Regions of Hill stability were determined using the full three-body theory for the planetary candidates that were found by the Kepler mission to lie in the Habitable Zone of the host star with radii larger than 3 Earth radii. The values obtained give a more accurate assessment of the sphere of influence of a planet than does the Hill radius using the restricted three-body expression. The values given by the two estimates for circular orbits are compared. The variation in the full three-body Hill regions were examined for a variety of possible moon masses and orbital eccentricities and inclinations. It was found that the critical moon planet separation decreased with increased moon orbital eccentricity and inclination but to a far greater extent when the planetary orbital eccentricity increased suggesting they would lie inside the Roche limit and are unlikely to have formed or exist now. The angular separation of the moon and planet and the radial velocity amplitudes of the planets likely to be observed are also affected. This is important for future observations and missions. It was also found that the giant planets in the habitable zone lie in a narrow band that can be fitted by a linear regression relation between log<SUB>10</SUB>(Planet luminosity) and log<SUB>10</SUB> (Planet temperature) with a slope of 3.34.","links_data":["{\"access\": \"\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"electr\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.pss.2020.105033\"}"],"property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"19262349","page":["105033"],"bibcode":"2020P&SS..19205033D","identifier":["2020P&SS..19205033D","10.1016/j.pss.2020.105033","10.1016/j.pss.2020.105033"],"author":["Donnison, J.

We simulate the evolution of SMSs and show that the escape velocity from their surface is ≈several ×10<SUP>3</SUP>kms<SUP>-1</SUP> , with large uncertainties. We could not converge with the parameters of the evolutionary numerical code MESA to resolve the uncertainties for SMS evolution. Under the assumption that the jets carry about ten percent of the mass of the SMS, we show that the energy in the jets is a substantial fraction of the binding energy of the gas in the galaxy/bulge. Therefore, the jets that the SMS progenitor of the SMBH launches carry sufficient energy to establish a feedback cycle with the gas in the inner zone of the galaxy/bulge, and hence, set a relation between the total stellar mass and the mass of the SMS. As the SMS collapses to form the SMBH at the center, there is already a relation (correlation) between the newly born SMBH mass and the stellar mass of the galaxy/bulge. During the formation of the SMBH it rapidly accretes mass from the collapsing SMS and launches very energetic jets that might unbind most of the gas in the galaxy/bulge.","links_data":["{\"access\": \"open\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"preprint\", \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03046\"}","{\"access\": \"\", \"instances\": \"\", \"title\": \"\", \"type\": \"electr\", \"url\": \"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.newast.2020.101438\"}"],"pubnote":["Accepted to New Astronomy; doi:10.1016/j.newast.2020.101438"],"property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"19188245","page":["101438"],"bibcode":"2020NewA...8101438B","author":["Bear, Ealeal","Soker, Noam"],"esources":["EPRINT_HTML","EPRINT_PDF","PUB_HTML"],"email":["ealeal@physics.technion.ac.il","soker@physics.technion.ac.il"],"citation_count":0,"pub":"New Astronomy","volume":"81","doi":["10.1016/j.newast.2020.101438"],"keyword":["Galaxies: Active","(Galaxies:) quasars: Supermassive black holes","Galaxies: Jets","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"doctype":"article","read_count":60,"pub_raw":"New Astronomy, Volume 81, article id. 101438.","title":["Jet-driven AGN feedback in galaxy formation before black hole formation"],"[citations]":{"num_references":83,"num_citations":0}}]}}
